Good. Now the next thing to implement is... I want to be able to transcribe... I want to add an option to the system training menu. And it should be... It should only be available if there is no recording going on. And it should be above open recording directory. And here we should have... Manually transcribe. And this should open like this. A window next to it with two alternatives. And here we should have... Transcribe latest file. And then this should do a... Start a transcription similar to how the manual transcribe... Python file that I have works. So it's just going to... The point here is if it fails a crash or anything, then you could do this. So it will take the latest recorded file. And it will redo it and the error is... If the transcription failed, then you will need to... You still have the audio file, but then you can do this and it will try again on the latest file. And then you should also be able to choose by going to the same manual transcription and then hovering your mouse on it. And like I said, it opens up and shows two alternatives. And those alternatives is... The other alternative is choose file name. And if you click that, you can browse. Opens up of Windows and enables you to browse. And then you can choose a specific audio file that it will be using. And then it will just take that file name. And it will use that file name instead. The latest one is just that it takes the latest folder with the audio file in it. And it might have to try both the 16 kHz and non-16 kHz version because we don't know which one exists. And then we save it as a manual transcription. Text file, so not transcription, just manual transcription. And then we are not pasting it out and writing it out instead. You should be able to copy. And here comes the last... Thank you for watching.
